It's Java based console profile generator that generates you random combined name/age/citiy, country.  
The only thing is you gotta feed it names and cities. If you exceed the 1000 threads in the ExecutorService with names and cities just update the threads to bigger number.
Also keep in mind that its good to keep both names and cities with equal number of items in each so you avoid any type of issues.
